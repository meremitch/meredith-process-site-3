                <p class="info">The Design Challenge was an extremely important part of the process of figuring out
                    exactly who Southeast Corgi Rescue client is. Using questions from the IDEO Human Centered Design
                    Toolkit, I got define my design challenge in order to best form solutions to the design problem.</p>

            <!--AUDIENCE & GOALS: EXAMPLE FORMATTING-->
            <div class="row">
                <div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/catergories.jpg" alt="catergories notes" /></span></div>
                <div class="6u$">
                    <p>First, I began by determining the four categories: Who Does Southeast Corgi Rescue help, Audience
                        or Donors, Volunteers, and Skeptics. Once I determined these categories, I then started to add
                        sticky notes under the categories that break down what these mean further. They are then
                        organized from most important to least important or from most likely to least likely.
