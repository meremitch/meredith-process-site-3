				<h1>Primary & Secondary Research</h1>
				<p class="info">For this website redesign, I researched my client, Southeast Corgi Rescue, as well as
					various other animal non-profit websites. Also, aiming to be well informed, I also researched
					related articles and news in this field.</p>
			</header>
			<h1>Primary Research</h1>
			<h2>Research on the non-profit Southeast Corgi Rescue</h2>
			<p>All design problems go through three main phases: inspiration, ideation, and implementation. In the
				ideation phase, is research. By researching, we can learn everything there is to know about our client
				before we have enough information to come up with the adequate solutions. </p>
			<p>The first part of the research consists of compiling all of the information about the organization,
				through their current online website, advertisement and social media they may have posted, and any other
				relevant material we can find. Gathering images of the current website is especially important. These
				collected images are used to visually show what has and has not worked for the organization in the past
				for their website.
			</p>
			<p>Listed on their site, it is their mission, stating...</p>
			<p>“Southeast Corgi Rescue Incorporated is a non-profit, all-volunteer group of dog lovers serving the
				states of NC, SC and GA. Our rescue is breed specific and works with corgis and corgi mixes.</p>
			<p>Dogs in our care are vetted, spayed or neutered and receive all appropriate veterinary care and
				treatment, to include vaccinations and microchips. Our dogs are placed in nurturing foster homes
				throughout the three states and are socialized and trained until we feel they can be successfully placed
				in a suitable, caring permanent home.”
			</p>
			<p>As time and resources allow, we also strive to:</p>
			<p>1) Assist individuals with challenges pertaining to their corgis.
			</p>
			<p>2) Raise funds to support our organization.</p>
			<p>3) Guide and educate the public in issues related to animal welfare and the humane and proper care of
				dogs.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Here are some images of Southeast Corgi Rescue’s website as well as images of their various social media
				pages.</p>

				<h1>Secondary Research</h1>
				<h2>Important stats pertaining to animal rescue:
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Approximately 6.5 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year. Of
						those, approximately 3.3 million are dogs.</li>
					<li>Of the 6.5 million cats and dogs brought into shelters, just under 50% get adopted.</li>
					<li>Approximately 1.6 million dogs are adopted from shelters every year.</li>
					<li>Each year, approximately 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized (670,000 dogs).</li>
					<li>#1 Most Common Breed in Shelters: American Pit Bull Terrier</li>
					<li>#1 Most Common Breed Adopted from Shelters: Golden Retriever</li>
					<li>About 30% of animals in shelters are left there by their owners.</li>
					<li>Animal shelters cost US citizens, almost $2 billion every year.</li>
					<li>There are 3,500 animal shelters in the US.</li>
					<li>Altogether, there are around 14,000 shelters and rescue groups in the U.S.
					</li>
					<p>
						The worst part: of the 3 million cats and dogs euthanized in shelters each year, approximately
						2.4 million (80%) are healthy and treatable and could have been adopted into new homes. - the
						Humane Society

				<h2>Relevant Articles to Southeast Corgi Rescue:</h2>
				<h3>How the COVID-19 Pandemic is affecting Adoptions in the USA:</h3>
				<p>COVID-19 has impacted everything in the world around us - even the amount of animals that are getting
					rescued. Because people are feeling lonely as they quarantine alone in their homes and have more
					time to potentially spend on pets, the rate at which dogs and cats are getting adopted has
					skyrocketed.</p>
				<p>The New York Times writes: </p>
				<p>“KC Pet Project, a nonprofit animal shelter in Kansas City, Mo., received 250 requests to foster pets
					in four days, according to Tori Fugate, a spokeswoman for the shelter. Usually, getting 10 pets
					placed in foster homes is a good day for the organization.
					“To have that many new people sign up is really a big spike,” she said.”
				</p>
				<h3>Who donates to animal rescue sites, such as this one?</h3>
				<img src="images/donations.jpeg"
					alt="This is an image of a chart showing who donates to animal charities." width="1000"
					height="600">

				<p>According to the chart above, women, non-religious, and politically liberal people were more likely
					to prioritize an animal charity above all others.</p>
				<p>There are people who would rather donate to health, children’s, military,
					emergency services, youth development, and/or formal education charities rather than an animal charity. These individuals were
					less likely than others to prioritize animals over other charitable interests.</p>
				<p>In another chart, also on the faunalytics.com website, it shows that high income individuals, people
					who undertake vegan diets and have a hobby that involves animals, such as a dog trainer.</p>
				<p>What Predicts Having A Recurring Donation To An Animal Cause? According to this website, people who
					are more religious are most likely to give a recurring donation to an animal cause.</p>

				<h2>Successful Animal Rescue Sites</h2>
				<h3>ASPCA & The Humane Society</h3>
				<p>The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) and The Humane Society are both
					also non-profit, animal organizations. Seeing as Southeast Corgi Rescue is too, I looked for advice
					here. These two sites are widely known, used, and donated to. For these two sites, the user
					immediately is struck with imagery of sick animals that pulls at the viewers heartstrings. They
					appeal to your emotions. While I do not want to picture sick corgis on the Southeast Corgi Rescue
					site, something is to be said for the way these images just pull you in and want to make you donate.
					Along with this, they have buttons that are easy to navigate such as the “Donate and “Give Monthly”
					button. These two sites are very easy and clear to navigate, which I am striving to achieve with the
					Southeast Corgi Rescue site as well. They also give you options to stay up to date with them in the
					footer and in the banner, such as signing up for email. All these elements and more seen on their
					websites make a really strong website that has been demonstrated to work for these two sites. These
					two websites will give me insight on what works and what does not for Animal Rescue sights in order
					to improve the Southeast Corgi Rescue site.

				<h1>Interviews</h1>

				<h4>I was able to meet with the two potential users of the Southeast Corgi Rescue website to gain
					important primary information about SCR.</h4>

				<h2>User Interviews: Kasra & Cathy</h2>

				<p>My first interview was with Kasra. Kasra is a 32-year-old professor of science-based in Greenville,
					South Carolina. He just recently adopted his first dog with his wife but had been looking into dog
					adoption for many years. Before his recent adoption, he spent a lot of time looking at different
					animal humane society sites. He is equally passionate about science as he is about dogs,
					specifically corgis with their short legs and chubby bodies.</p>

				<p>Summary: He found out about the Southeast Corgi Rescue Website through a Google search and has been
					looking to adopt a corgi from the site. He
					really likes how the website displays the list of dogs available and how they maintained the site by
					posting updates about COVID and different topics. Kasra dislikes the lack of mobile compatibility
					and made it apparent how important he believes that aspect should be in a successful website
					redesign. He also mentions how there should be consistent use of pictures: a set width and amount of
					high-quality pictures would be great. He says more information about each dog would be extremely
					useful and the homepage needs more updating. The homepage and navigation bar are very confusing; the
					drop-down menu needs major help or a total redesign. Another issue he mentioned was the way of
					contacting Southeast Corgi Rescue and how it was confusing, with not a clear email to contact and a
					very poorly set up adoption form. The main issues were inconsistent layout, overall confusion
					regarding how to use the website, and major disorganization.</p>


				<p>My second interview was with Cathy. Cathy is a 66-year-old home-health nurse. She has been rescuing
					dogs for many years and enjoys it greatly. Most of her dogs were given to her by owners that could
					not handle their care any longer. Her sons and husband have brought her many dogs that needed
					rescuing over the years and Cathy has welcomed them and given them a good home. She has had many,
					many dogs: Zwinky, a pitbull, Flip and Tigger, both yellow labs, Brownie, a Britney Spaniel, Shelia,
					a Shetland sheepdog, and several more.</p>


				<p>Summary: She said one of the most important things to her when
					adopting off websites are high-quality, consistent pictures of the dogs and a long description
					telling them about them. She says that qualities such as “how old they are, special needs if they
					are house-trained and up to date on shots” are especially important to know and should always be
					included. She said the website was not clear on how to get in touch with them - she particularly
					stressed the importance of a phone number, which is surprisingly not listed on the Southeast Corgi
					Rescue website. She also said linked social media accounts are important to her, such as Instagram
					or Facebook. Cathy says that she would want the website to be clean and organized with not too many
					frills and unneeded elements, but instead placing importance on the dogs that need homes. While the
					website is clean and informative, it should also be warm and friendly. </p>
