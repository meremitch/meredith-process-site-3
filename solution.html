			<h2>Call to Action</h2>

			<h3> After the research, I formed a Call to Action to accomplish the goal of the website, as well as a
				style tile to help convey the general feel.</h3>

			<img src="images/MMitchell-Call-to-Action.jpg" alt="My Call to Action Buttons" width="600" height="auto" />

			<p> </p>

			<p>I have chosen to put four actions for the Call to Action buttons: donate, adopt, foster, and
				volunteer. I was unable to choose one or two of these calls to action because they are all so
				important and are equal in the need for each action. The organization needs donations and volunteers
				to keep going, but the whole point of the organization is to get corgis forever homes. The Call to
				Action buttons are short and concise, showing the website user exactly what the button will lead
				them to the donate button to donate, the adopt button to adopt a corgi, the foster button to foster
				a corgi, and the volunteer button to volunteer to SCR. These buttons will be easy to understand so
				that Southeast Corgi Rescue can accomplish the goals they have for their organization.
			</p>

			<h2>Style Tile</h2>

			<h3> I created a style tile to help convey the general feel of the website I will design.</h3>

			<img src="images/Southeast-Corgi-Rescue.jpeg" alt="My Style Tile" width="1100" height="auto" />

			<p> </p>

			<p>The adjectives I chose to visually describe the Southeast Corgi Rescue website I want to create are kind,
				nurturing, courageous, compassionate, trustworthy, and friendly. These adjectives would help a user feel
				welcome and would encourage them to trust Southeast Corgi Rescue enough to donate to them, volunteer at
				the organization, or adopt or foster a corgi from them.
			</p>


			<p>I chose the typeface Helvetica for my large headings and Charter for my subheadings. These type choices
				appear sophisticated and are easy to read. I updated the logo while keeping the corgi outline from the
				original, to be more simplistic. Instead of showing the outlines of all the states in which SCR is
				located, I chose to list the abbreviations of the states in the logo itself: NC, SC & GA. For the body
				copy and some second headlines, I will use Baskerville because the words are very easy to read and still
				look sophisticated.</p>


			<p>I want to use imagery that seems happy, warm and shows corgis and corgis with their owners. This will
				encourage individuals to adopt or foster because they can visualize themselves as the corgi owners seen
				on the website. These precious images will also help to encourage donations and volunteers. </p>


			<p>The color scheme is also aimed at feeling kind and friendly, with warm colors: neutrals, sage green,
				mustard yellow, pumpkin orange, ivory, and coral. Small touches of color in some elements will bring
				life to the website as well as unite the page.

			</p>

			<p>The style tile also showcases the new logo I designed for Southeast Corgi Rescue to match their new, more
				modern, simplistic branding style. I wanted the logo to be simple but also informative by telling the
				full name of the organization, where they are located, and show an outline of a corgi, which was on
				their last logo. I chose to do everything in white to keep the logo very clean looking.
